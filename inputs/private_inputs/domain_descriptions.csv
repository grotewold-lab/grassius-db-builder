Mutations in the sequences of these proteins affect flower and leaf development. LFY is a plant-specific transcription factor (TF) essential for flower development. It is one of the few master regulators of flower development, as it integrates environmental and endogenous signals to orchestrate the whole floral network. Transcription factors such as LFY, recognize short DNA motifs primarily through their DNA-binding domain. Upon binding to short stretches of DNA called cis-elements or TF binding sites (TFBS), they regulate gene expression. This entry represents the DNA binding domain found in C-terminal of LFY proteins in plants.

The U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) binds to the pre-mRNA 5 splice site (ss) at early stages of spliceosome assembly. Recruitment of U1 to a class of weak 5 ss is promoted by binding of the protein TIA-1 to uridine-rich sequences immediately downstream from the 5 ss. Binding of TIA-1 in the vicinity of a 5 ss helps to stabilise U1 snRNP recruitment, at least in part, via a direct interaction with U1-C, thus providing one molecular mechanism for the function of this splicing regulator. This domain is probably a zinc-binding. It is found in multiple copies in some members of the family."

Mutations in the sequences of these proteins affect flower and leaf development. LFY proteins have been shown to binds semi-palindromic 19-bp DNA elements through its highly conserved C-terminal DBD. In addition to its well-characterized DBD, LFY possesses a second conserved domain at its amino terminus (LFY-N). This entry represents the SAM domain found in N -terminal of LFY proteins in plants. Crystallographic structure determination of LFY-N shows that LFY-N is a Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) domain that mediates LFY oligomerization. It allows LFY to bind to regions lacking high-affinity LFYbs (LFY-binding sites) and confers on LFY the ability to access closed chromatin regions. Experiments carried out in plants, revealed that altering the capacity of LFY to oligomerize compromised its floral function and drastically reduced its genome-wide DNA binding. SAM oligomerization has been suggested to have a profound effect on a TF binding landscape by promoting cooperative binding of LFY to DNA, as was proposed for other oligomeric TFs, and it gives LFY access to closed chromatin regions that are notably refractory to TF binding. It has also been suggested that the biochemical properties of the SAM domain are evolutionary conserved in all plant species."

The complex associates with a specific subregion of the mitotic spindle leading to increased microtubule disassembly and targeting of p60 to the spindle poles. The assembly and function of the mitotic spindle requires the activity of a number of microtubule-binding proteins. Katanin, a heterodimeric microtubule-severing ATPase, is found localized at mitotic spindle poles. A proposed model is that katanin is targeted to spindle poles through a combination of direct microtubule binding by the p60 subunit and through interactions between the WD40 domain and an unknown protein."

It is arranged into four different sections, a core, a head, a tail and a kinase-activity part, and the number of subunits within each of these is what varies with species. Overall, Mediator regulates the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II but it would appear that each of the four different sections has a slightly different function. Mediator exists in two major forms in human cells: a smaller form that interacts strongly with pol II and activates transcription, and a large form that does not interact strongly with pol II and does not directly activate transcription. Notably, the small and large Mediator complexes differ in their subunit composition: the Med26 subunit preferentially associates with the small, active complex, whereas cdk8, cyclin C, Med12 and Med13 associate with the large Mediator complex. This family includesthe C terminal region of a number of eukaryotic hypothetical proteins which are homologous to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein IWS1.

PF04542.17,Sigma-70 region 2,"Region 2 of sigma-70 is the most conserved region of the entire protein. All members of this class of sigma-factor contain region 2. The high conservation is due to region 2 containing both the -10 promoter recognition helix and the primary core RNA polymerase binding determinant. The core binding helix, interacts with the clamp domain of the largest polymerase subunit, beta prime [1,2]. The aromatic residues of the recognition helix, found at the C-terminus of this domain are though to mediate strand separation, thereby allowing transcription initiation [1,2]."

PF03357.24,Snf7,"This family of proteins are involved in protein sorting and transport from the endosome to the vacuole/lysosome in eukaryotic cells. Vacuoles/lysosomes play an important role in the degradation of both lipids and cellular proteins. In order to perform this degradative function, vacuoles/lysosomes contain numerous hydrolases which have been transported in the form of inactive precursors via the biosynthetic pathway and are proteolytically activated upon delivery to the vacuole/lysosome. The delivery of transmembrane proteins, such as activated cell surface receptors to the lumen of the vacuole/lysosome, either for degradation/downregulation, or in the case of hydrolases, for proper localisation, requires the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). These late endosomal structures are formed by invaginating and budding of the limiting membrane into the lumen of the compartment. During this process, a subset of the endosomal membrane proteins is sorted into the forming vesicles. Mature MVBs fuse with the vacuole/lysosome, thereby releasing cargo containing vesicles into its hydrolytic lumen for degradation. Endosomal proteins that are not sorted into the intralumenal MVB vesicles are either recycled back to the plasma membrane or Golgi complex, or remain in the limiting membrane of the MVB and are thereby transported to the limiting membrane of the vacuole/lysosome as a consequence of fusion. Therefore, the MVB sorting pathway plays a critical role in the decision between recycling and degradation of membrane proteins. A few archaeal sequences are also present within this family."

Dihydrouridine modification of tRNA is widely observed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and also in some archae. Most dihydrouridines are found in the D loop of t-RNAs. The role of dihydrouridine in tRNA is currently unknown, but may increase conformational flexibility of the tRNA. It is likely that different family members have different substrate specificities, which may overlap. Dus 1 (Q9HGN6) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae acts on pre-tRNA-Phe, while Dus 2 (P53720) acts on pre-tRNA-Tyr and pre-tRNA-Leu. Dus 1 is active as a single subunit, requiring NADPH or NADH, and is stimulated by the presence of FAD. Some family members may be targeted to the mitochondria and even have a role in mitochondria."

Raffinose synthase ( EC:2.4.1.82) is the key enzyme that channels sucrose into the raffinose oligosaccharide pathway. Raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs) are ubiquitous in plant seeds and are thought to play critical roles in the acquisition of tolerance to desiccation and seed longevity. Raffinose synthases are alkaline alpha-galactosidases and are solely responsible for RFO breakdown in germinating maize seeds, whereas acidic galactosidases appear to have other functions.

PF03079.17,ARD/ARD family,"The two acireductone dioxygenase enzymes (ARD and ARD, previously known as E-2 and E-2) from Klebsiella pneumoniae share the same amino acid sequence Q9ZFE7 but bind different metal ions: ARD binds Ni2+, ARD binds Fe2+. ARD and ARD can be experimentally interconverted by removal of the bound metal ion and reconstitution with the appropriate metal ion. The two enzymes share the same substrate, 1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-(methylthio)pentene, but yield different products. ARD yields the alpha-keto precursor of methionine (and formate), thus forming part of the ubiquitous methionine salvage pathway that converts 5-methylthioadenosine (MTA) to methionine. This pathway is responsible for the tight control of the concentration of MTA, which is a powerful inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis and transmethylation reactions [1,2]. ARD yields methylthiopropanoate, carbon monoxide and formate, and thus prevents the conversion of MTA to methionine. The role of the ARD catalysed reaction is unclear: methylthiopropanoate is cytotoxic, and carbon monoxide can activate guanylyl cyclase, leading to increased intracellular cGMP levels [1,2]. This family also contains other members, whose functions are not well characterised."

PF02182.20,SAD/SRA domain,"The domain goes by several names including SAD SRA and YDG. It adopts a beta barrel, modified PUA-like, fold that is widely present in eukaryotic chromatin proteins and in bacteria. Versions of this domain are known to bind hemi-methylated CpG dinucleotides and also other 5mC containing dinucleotides. The domain binds DNA by flipping out the methylated cytosine base from the DNA double helix.The conserved tyrosine and aspartate residues and a glycine rich patch are critical for recognition of the flipped out base. Mammalian UHRF1 that contains this domain plays an important role in maintenance of methylation at CpG dinucleotides by recruiting DNMT1 to hemimethylated sites associated with replication forks. The SAD/SRA domain has been combined with other domains involved in the ubiquitin pathway on multiple occasions and such proteins link recognition of DNA methylation to chromatin-protein ubiquitination. The domain is also found in species that lack DNA methylation, such as certain apicomplexans, suggestive of other DNA-binding modes or functions. A highly derived and distinct version of the domain is also found in fungi where it is fused to AlkB-type 2OGFeDO domains.

PF12816.10,Golgi CORVET complex core vacuolar protein 8,"Vps8 is one of the Golgi complex components necessary for vacuolar sorting. Eukaryotic cells contain a highly dynamic endo-membrane system, in which individual organelles keep their identity despite continuous vesicle generation and fusion. Vesicles that bud from a donor membrane are targeted and delivered to each individual organelle, where they release their cargo after fusion with the acceptor membrane. Vps8 is the core component of the endosomal tethering complex CORVET (class C core vacuole/endosome tethering). Vps8 co-operates with Vps21-GTP to mediate endosomal clustering in a reaction that is dependent on Vps3. Vps8 is the only CORVET subunit that is enriched on late endosomes, suggesting that it is a marker for the maturation of late endosomes. Late endosomes form intralumenal vesicles, and the resulting multivesicular bodies fuse with the vacuole to release their cargoes."

These proteins associate with HDA1 to generate the activity of the HDA1 histone deacetylase complex. HDA1 interacts with itself and with the HDA2-HDA3 subcomplex to form a probable tetramer and these interactions are necessary for catalytic activity. The HDA1 histone deacetylase complex is responsible for the deacetylation of lysine residues on the N-terminal part of the core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4). Histone deacetylation gives a tag for epigenetic repression and plays an important role in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression and developmental events.

It has been demonstrated that SET domains mediate interactions with a family of proteins that display similarity with dual-specificity phosphatases (dsPTPases). A subset of SET domains have been called PR domains. These domains are divergent in sequence from other SET domains, but also appear to mediate protein-protein interaction. The SET domain consists of two regions known as SET-N and SET-C. SET-C forms an unusual and conserved knot-like structure of probably functional importance. Additionally to SET-N and SET-C, an insert region (SET-I) and flanking regions of high structural variability form part of the overall structure."

The resulting complex forms a protein ruler that measures out the spacing between two adjacent nucleosomes. The conserved basic residue in WHIM1 is involved in packing with the DDT motif. The module shows a great domain architectural diversity and is often combined with other modified histone peptide recognising and DNA binding domains, some of which discriminate methylated DNA."
PF03514.17,GRAS domain family,"Proteins in the GRAS (GAI, RGA, SCR) family are known as major players in gibberellin (GA) signaling, which regulates various aspects of plant growth and development. Mutation of the SCARECROW (SCR) gene results in a radial pattern defect, loss of a ground tissue layer, in the root. The PAT1 protein is involved in phytochrome A signal transduction. A sequence, structure and evolutionary analysis showed that the GRAS family emerged in bacteria and belongs to the Rossmann-fold, AdoMET (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase superfamily. All bacterial, and a subset of plant GRAS proteins, are predicted to be active and function as small-molecule methylases. Several plant GRAS proteins lack one or more AdoMet (SAM)-binding residues while preserving their substrate-binding residues. Although GRAS proteins are implicated to function as transcriptional factors, the above analysis suggests that they instead might either modify or bind small molecules."
PF11698.11,V-ATPase subunit H,The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is a multisubunit complex responsible for acidifying organelles. It functions as an ATP dependent proton pump that transports protons across a lipid bilayer. This domain corresponds to the C terminal domain of the H subunit of V-ATPase.

PF00013.32,KH domain,"KH motifs bind RNA in vitro. Autoantibodies to Nova, a KH domain protein, cause paraneoplastic opsoclonus ataxia."
PF07521.15,Zn-dependent metallo-hydrolase RNA specificity domain,"The metallo-beta-lactamase fold contains five sequence motifs. The first four motifs are found in PF00753 and are common to all metallo-beta-lactamases. This, the fifth motif appears to be specific to Zn-dependent metallohydrolases such as ribonuclease J 2 which are involved in the processing of mRNA [2,3]. This domain adds essential structural elements to the CASP-domain and is unique to RNA/DNA-processing nucleases, showing that they are pre-mRNA 3-end-processing endonucleases [2,3,4]."
PF06293.17,Lipopolysaccharide kinase (Kdo/WaaP) family,These lipopolysaccharide kinases are related to protein kinases PF00069. This family includes waaP (rfaP) gene product is required for the addition of phosphate to O-4 of the first heptose residue of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inner core region. It has previously been shown that WaaP is necessary for resistance to hydrophobic and polycationic antimicrobials in E. coli and that it is required for virulence in invasive strains of S. enterica.
