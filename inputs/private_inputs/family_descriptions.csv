VOZ,VOZ,TF,"A 38-bp pollen-specific cis-acting region of the AVP1 gene is involved in the expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana V-PPase during pollen development. Here, we report the isolation and structural characterization of AtVOZ1 and AtVOZ2, novel transcription factors that bind to the 38-bp cis-acting region of A. thaliana V-PPase gene, AVP1. AtVOZ1 and AtVOZ2 show 53% amino acid sequence similarity. Homologs of AtVOZ1 and AtVOZ2 are found in various vascular plants as well as a moss, Physcomitrella patens. Promoter-?-glucuronidase reporter analysis shows that AtVOZ1 is specifically expressed in the phloem tissue and AtVOZ2 is strongly expressed in the root. In vivo transient effector-reporter analysis in A. thaliana suspension-cultured cells demonstrates that AtVOZ1 and AtVOZ2 function as transcriptional activators in the Arabidopsis cell. Two conserved regions termed Domain-A and Domain-B were identified from an alignment of AtVOZ proteins and their homologs of O. sativa and P. patens. AtVOZ2 binds as a dimer to the specific palindromic sequence, GCGTNx7ACGC, with Domain-B, which is comprised of a functional novel zinc coordinating motif and a conserved basic region. Domain-B is shown to function as both the DNA-binding and the dimerization domains of AtVOZ2. From highly the conservative nature among all identified VOZ proteins, we conclude that Domain-B is responsible for the DNA binding and dimerization of all VOZ-family proteins and designate it as the VOZ-domain."
MYB-related,MYBR,TF,"A novel myb-like gene (AtmybL2) was isolated from an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library. The single copy gene was localised on chromosome I. A gene specific transcript is preferentially found in leaves. The predicted gene product consists of a conservative N-terminal myb-domain known to be involved in DNA-binding and a unique proline-rich C-terminal part. Remarkably, the myb-domain includes only one of the typical two or three tryptophan repeats found in other myb-like proteins."
NAC,NAC,TF,"Auxin plays a key role in lateral root formation, but the signaling pathway for this process is poorly understood. We show here that NAC1, a new member of the NAC family, is induced by auxin and mediates auxin signaling to promote lateral root development. NAC1 is a transcription activator consisting of an N-terminal conserved NAC-domain that binds to DNA and a C-terminal activation domain. This factor activates the expression of two downstream auxin-responsive genes, DBP and AIR3. Transgenic plants expressing sense or antisense NAC1 cDNA show an increase or reduction of lateral roots, respectively. Finally, TIR1-induced lateral root development is blocked by expression of antisense NAC1 cDNA, and NAC1 overexpression can restore lateral root formation in the auxin-response mutant tir1, indicating that NAC1 acts downstream of TIR1."
BZR,BZR,TF,"Brassinosteroid (BR) homeostasis and signaling are crucial for normal growth and development of plants. BR signaling through cell-surface receptor kinases and intracellular components leads to dephosphorylation and accumulation of the nuclear protein BZR1. How BR signaling regulates gene expression, however, remains unknown. Here we show that BZR1 is a transcriptional repressor that has a previously unknown DNA binding domain and binds directly to the promoters of feedback-regulated BR biosynthetic genes. Microarray analyses identified additional potential targets of BZR1 and illustrated, together with physiological studies, that BZR1 coordinates BR homeostasis and signaling by playing dual roles in regulating BR biosynthesis and downstream growth responses."
E2F-DP,E2F,TF,"E2F/DP complexes play a pivotal role in the regulation of the G1/S transition in animals. Recently, plant E2F homologs have been cloned, but DP-related sequences have not been identified so far. Here we report that Arabidopsis thaliana contains at least two different DP-related genes, AtDPa and AtDPb. They exhibit an overall domain organization similar to that of their animal counterparts, although phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that they form a separate subgroup. AtDPs efficiently heterodimerize in vitro with the Arabidopsis E2F-related proteins, AtE2Fa and AtE2Fb through their dimerization domains. AtDPa and AtE2Fa are predominantly produced in actively dividing cells with highest transcript levels in early S phase cells."
Trihelix,THX,TF,"GT-2 is a plant transcriptional activator that contains two separate, but similar, trihelix DNA-binding domains. GT-1 is similar to GT-2, although it contains only one of such domains. cDNAs that encode GT-2 were isolated from rice (OS-GT2) and Arabidopsis (AT-GT2). Evidence is presented for the existence of an Arabidopsis gene family that is structurally related to AT-GT2. Two members of this GT2-like family, AT-GTL1 and AT-GTL2, have been isolated and characterized. Their sequences suggest that they evolved by a recent gene duplication event. Both AT-GT2 and AT-GTL genes contain an intron in the amino-terminal trihelix motif, indicating that this DNA-binding domain resulted from exon shuffling. RNA gel blot analysis using AT-GTL1 as a probe revealed four transcripts in the aerial part of the plant. All mRNA levels were significantly higher in siliques, suggesting that this gene family may function in fruit and/or seed development. To date, DNA-binding proteins characterized by the trihelix motif have been described only in plants, and may therefore be involved in plant-specific processes. Our results show that in Arabidopsis thaliana, the trihelix motif is not restricted to the GT-1 and GT-2 DNA-binding proteins."
HSF,HSF,TF,"Heat shock factors (HSF) are the transcriptional activators of the heat shock response. The conversion of constitutively expressed HSF to a form that can bind DNA requires the trimerization of the protein, involving leucine zipper interactions as shown for yeast, Drosophila, chicken and human HSFs. Like other metazoan HSFs, the endogenous Arabidopsis HSF displays heat shock-inducible DNA-binding activity in gel retardation assays. The heat shock-inducible binding of a recombinant Arabidopsis HSF (ATHSF1) expressed in Arabidopsis plants suggests that ATHSF1 is the major heat shock factor regulating the heat stress response. However, on transient expression in Drosophila and human cells, ATHSF1 fails to exhibit proper regulation, as demonstrated by constitutive binding to DNA, and by constitutive expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene under the control of the Drosophila hsp70 promoter. These results suggest that the regulation of ATHSF1 is normally dependent on a specific factor that inhibits the DNA-binding and transcriptional activities under non-heat shock conditions."
ZIM,ZIM,TF,"Jasmonates (JAs) are essential hormones for plant defense and development. Jasmonate ZIM-domain proteins are repressors of JA signaling, Most members of the JAZ gene family are highly expressed in response to mechanical wounding. JAZ proteins are targeted by the E3-ubiquitin ligase SCF(COI1) for proteasome degradation in response to JA. MYC2, a positive regulator of JA-dependent responses, has been identified as a target of JAZ repressors (PMID:18223147,PMID:18653378)."
NOZZLE/SPOROCYTELESS,NZZ/SPL,TF,"NZZ/SPL is a gene involved in controlling stamen identity as well as a vital role in the adaxial/abaxial patterning of ovules, and determining leaf shape in Arabidopsis thaliana. It interacts with members of YABBY to establish ovule patterns, as well as stamen identity genes to establish stamen identity (PMID:19726570; PMID:12183381). NZZ/SPL is thought to regulate auxin homeostasis by repressing members of the YUCCA family (PMID:18557819)."
G2-like,GLK,TF,"In the C4 plant maize, three photosynthetic cell types differentiate: C4 bundle sheath, C4 mesophyll, and C3 mesophyll cells. C3 mesophyll cells represent the ground state, whereas C4 bundle sheath and C4 mesophyll cells are specialized cells that differentiate in response to light-induced positional signals. The Golden2 (G2) gene regulates plastid biogenesis in all photosynthetic cells during the C3 stages of development. However, G2 function is specifically committed to the differentiation of bundle sheath cell chloroplasts in C4 leaf blades. In this article, we report the isolation of G2-like (Glk) genes from maize and rice, providing evidence for a family of Glk genes in plants. The expression profiles of the rice Glk genes suggest that these genes may act redundantly to promote photosynthetic development in this C3 species. In maize, G2 and ZmGlk1 transcripts accumulate primarily in C4 bundle sheath and C4 mesophyll cells, respectively, suggesting a specific role for each gene in C4 differentiation. We show that G2 and ZmGLK1 both can transactivate reporter gene transcription and dimerize in yeast, which supports the idea that these proteins act as transcriptional regulators of cell-type differentiation processes."
MADS,MADS,TF,"MADS-box genes are a family of transcription factors found in plants, animals and fungi and are characterized by a conserved MADS domain.  MADS-box genes have been found in all major plant lineages studied to date including green algae, mosses, ferns, gymnosperms and angiosperms. In Arabidopsis, MADS-box genes can be divided into three groups: Type I and Type II MADS box genes and MADS-like genes.  Type II MADS box genes in plants can be further subdivided into the MIKCC and MIKC* types (reviewed in (Becker and Theissen, 2003)).  Type I MADS-box genes contain a conserved MADS-box gene, but lack the relatively conserved I and K and highly divergent C domains found in the Type II MIKC type MADS-box genes.<br>Function has been characterized for less than one fifth of the members of the MADS-box gene family. However, in recent years several thorough expression and evolutionary studies have been published investigating the underlying similarities and differences among these genes, especially the TYPE II MIKCC genes.<br>Among the TYPE II MIKC genes there have been approximately 19 genes that have been functionally characterized.  These genes include many of the so called floral MADS-box genes (Theissen et al., 2000).  These genes, along with other genes that have been less well characterized but are hypothesized to preferentially affect floral organ development, includes AGAMOUS (AG), AGL6, AGL13, APETALA1 (AP1), APETALA3 (AP3), CAULIFLOWER (CAL), PISTILLATA (PI), SEEDSTICK (STK), SEPALLATA1,2,3,4 (SEP1,2,3,4), SHATTERPROOF1 and 2 (SHP1, 2) and TRANSPARENT TESTA16 (TT16).  Additionally, several genes with either identified or hypothesized function regulating floral timing and inflorescence development have been identified including AGL24, AGL27, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) (also known as FLOWERING LOCUS F (FLF)), FLC1, FLC2, FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM) (also known as MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING1 (MAF1), FRUITFUL (FUL), SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) and SUPRESSOR OF CONSTANS (SOC1).  Lastly, there are the non-floral genes, a group that mostly have currently unknown function.  These genes have diverse expression that most likely reflects a multitude of function including floral development as well as root, seed, seedling, stem and leaf development.  These genes include AGL12, AGL14, AGL15, AGL16, AGL17, AGL18, AGL19, AGL21 and ANR1.<br>In contrast to the many studies of TYPE II MIKC MADS box genes, only one Type I MADS-box gene, PHERES1 (formerly AGL37), has been investigated to date.  The function of PHERES1 has not yet been described, but based on expression studies it is maternally regulated by MEDEA and appears to be involved in proper seed and embryo development (Kohler et al., 2003; Kohler et al., 2005).  With the multitude of recent advances in analyses of gene expression and genomics we can expect many more studies of the pathways involving previously unidentified MADS-box genes along with functional characterization of these genes."
GRAS,GRAS,TF,"Mutations at the SCARECROW (SCR) locus in Arabidopsis thaliana result in defective radial patterning in the root and shoot. The SCR gene product contains sequences which suggest that it is a transcription factor. A number of Arabidopsis Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) have been identified that encode gene products bearing remarkable similarity to SCR throughout their carboxyl-termini, indicating that SCR is the prototype of a novel gene family. These ESTs have been designated SCARECROW-LIKE (SCL). The gene products of the GIBBERELLIN-INSENSITIVE (GAI) and the REPRESSOR of ga1-3 (RGA) loci show high structural and sequence similarity to SCR and the SCLs. Sequence analysis of the products of the GRAS (GAI, RGA, SCR) gene family indicates that they share a variable amino-terminus and a highly conserved carboxyl-terminus that contains five recognizable motifs. The SCLs have distinct patterns of expression, but all of those analyzed show expression in the root. One of them, SCL3, has a tissue-specific pattern of expression in the root similar to SCR. The importance of the GRAS gene family in plant biology has been established by the functional analyses of SCR, GAI and RGA."
EIL,EIL,TF,"Mutations in the Arabidopsis ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) gene severely limit a plant's response to the gaseous hormone ethylene. ein3 mutants show a loss of ethylene-mediated effects including gene expression, the triple response, cell growth inhibition, and accelerated senescence. EIN3 acts downstream of the histidine kinase ethylene receptor, ETR1, and the Raf-like kinase, CTR1. The EIN3 gene encodes a novel nuclear-localized protein that shares sequence similarity, structural features, and genetic function with three EIN3-LIKE (EIL) proteins. In addition to EIN3, EIL1 orEIL2 were able to complement ein3, suggesting their participation in the ethylene signaling pathway. Overexpression of EIN3 or EIL1 in wild-type or ethylene-insensitive2 plants conferred constitutive ethylene phenotypes, indicating their sufficiency for activation of the pathway in the absence of ethylene."
GRF,GRF,TF,"Previously, we identified a novel rice gene, GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR1 (OsGRF1), which encodes a putative transcription factor that appears to play a regulatory role in stem elongation. We now describe the GRF gene family of Arabidopsis thaliana (AtGRF), which comprises nine members. The deduced AtGRF proteins contain the same characteristic regions--the QLQ (Gln, Leu, Gln) and WRC (Trp, Arg, Cys) domains--as do OsGRF1 and related proteins in rice, as well as features indicating a function in transcriptional regulation. Most of the AtGRF genes are strongly expressed in actively growing and developing tissues, such as shoot tips, flower buds, and roots, but weakly in mature stem and leaf tissues. Overexpression of AtGRF1 and AtGRF2 resulted in larger leaves and cotyledons, as well as in delayed bolting of the inflorescence stem when compared to wild-type plants. In contrast, triple insertional null mutants of AtGRF1-AtGRF3 had smaller leaves and cotyledons, whereas single mutants displayed no changes in phenotype and double mutants displayed only minor ones. The alteration of leaf growth in overexpressors and triple mutants was based on an increase or decrease in cell size, respectively. These results indicate that AtGRF proteins play a role in the regulation of cell expansion in leaf and cotyledon tissues."
WHIRLY,WHIRLY,TF,"Transcriptional reprogramming is critical for plant disease resistance responses; its global control is not well understood. Salicylic acid (SA) can induce plant defense gene expression and a long-lasting disease resistance state called systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Plant-specific Whirly DNA binding proteins were previously implicated in defense gene regulation. We demonstrate that the potato StWhy1 protein is a transcriptional activator of genes containing the PBF2 binding PB promoter element. DNA binding activity of AtWhy1, the Arabidopsis StWhy1 ortholog, is induced by SA and is required for both SA-dependent disease resistance and SA-induced expression of an SAR response gene. AtWhy1 is required for both full basal and specific disease resistance responses. The transcription factor-associated protein NPR1 is also required for SAR. Surprisingly, AtWhy1 activation by SA is NPR1 independent, suggesting that AtWhy1 works in conjunction with NPR1 to transduce the SA signal. Our analysis of AtWhy1 adds a critical component to the SA-dependent plant disease resistance response."
CAMTA,CAMTA,TF,"Screening of cDNA expression libraries derived from plants exposed to stress, with 35S-labeled recombinant calmodulin as a probe, revealed a new family of proteins containing a transcription activation domain and two types of DNA-binding domains designated the CG-1 domain and the transcription factor immunoglobulin domain, ankyrin repeats, and a varying number of IQ calmodulin-binding motifs. Based on domain organization and amino acid sequence comparisons, similar proteins, with the same domain organization, were identified in the genomes of other multicellular organisms including human, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis, whereas none were found in the complete genomes of single cell eukaryotes and prokaryotes. This family of proteins was designated calmodulin-binding transcription activators (CAMTAs). Arabidopsis thaliana contains six CAMTA genes (AtCAMTA1-AtCAMTA6). The transcription activation domain of AtCAMTA1 was mapped by testing a series of protein fusions with the DNA-binding domain of the bacterial LexA transcription factor and two reporter genes fused to LexA recognition sequences in yeast cells. Two human proteins designated HsCAMTA1 and HsCAMTA2 were also shown to activate transcription in yeast using the same reporter system. Subcellular fractionation of Arabidopsis tissues revealed the presence of CAMTAs predominantly in the nucleus. Calmodulin binding assays identified a region of 25 amino acids capable of binding calmodulin with high affinity (K(d) = 1.2 nm) in the presence of calcium. We suggest that CAMTAs comprise a conserved family of transcription factors in a wide range of multicellular eukaryotes, which possibly respond to calcium signaling by direct binding of calmodulin."
SBP,SBP,TF,"The Arabidopsis thaliana SPL gene family represents a group of structurally diverse genes encoding putative transcription factors found apparently only in plants. The distinguishing characteristic of the SPL gene family is the SBP-box encoding a conserved protein domain of 76 amino acids in length, the SBP-domain, which is responsible for the interaction with DNA. We present here characterisation of 12 members of the SPL gene family. These genes show highly diverse genomic organisations and are found scattered over the Arabidopsis genome. Some SPL genes are constitutively expressed, while transcriptional activity of others is under developmental control. Based on phylogenetic reconstruction, gene structure and expression patterns, they can be divided into subfamilies. In addition to the Arabidopsis SPL genes, we isolated and determined the sequences of three SBP-box genes from Antirrhinum majus and seven from Zea mays."
TCP,TCP,TF,"The cycloidea (cyc) and teosinte branched 1 (tb1) genes code for structurally related proteins implicated in the evolution of key morphological traits. However, the biochemical function of CYC and TB1 proteins remains to be demonstrated. To address this problem, we have analysed the predicted secondary structure of regions conserved between CYC and TB1, and looked for related proteins of known function. One of the conserved regions is predicted to form a non-canonical basic-Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLP) structure. This domain is also found in two rice DNA-binding proteins, PCF1 and PCF2, where it has been shown to be involved in DNA-binding and dimerization. This indicates that the conserved domain most probably defines a new family of transcription factors, which we have termed the TCP family after its first characterised members (TB1, CYC and PCFs). Other plant proteins of unknown function also belong to this family. We have studied two of these in Arabidopsis and have shown that they are expressed in rapidly growing floral primordia. This, together with the proposed involvement of cyc and tb1 in influencing meristem growth, suggests that many members of the TCP family may affect cell division. Some of these genes may have been recruited during plant evolution to generate new morphological traits."
WRKY,WRKY,TF,"The WRKY proteins are a superfamily of transcription factors with up to 100 representatives in Arabidopsis. Family members appear to be involved in the regulation of various physio-logical programs that are unique to plants, including pathogen defense, senescence and trichome development. In spite of the strong conservation of their DNA-binding domain, the overall structures of WRKY proteins are highly divergent and can be categorized into distinct groups, which might reflect their different functions."
BBR/BPC,BBR,TF,"There are seven members of the plant specific BBR/BPC-family of transcription factors found in the Arabidopsis genome. The 80 - 90 amino acids at the extreme C-terminus of the protein constitute the highly conserved basic DNA-binding domain (Santi et al., 2003).Functionally, the BBR/BPC-family appears to play a role in the regulation of basal transcription. These proteins were identified initially in soybean by their ability to bind to the (GA/TC)n - dinucleotide repeat enhancer element from the GSA1-promoter (Sangwan and O'Brian, 2002).Analysis of a dominant active mutation in the barley homeobox gene BKn3 resulted in the identification of a transcription factor, named barley B recombinant (BBR), that binds to a (GA/TC)8- dinucleotide repeat in the third intron of BKn3 (Santi et al., 2003). It could be shown that BBR localizes to the nucleus and was able to activate GUS-expression in Nicotiana protoplasts. It was considered that BBR is an essential upstream regulatory factor for proper homeobox gene expression in barley (Santi et al., 2003).This was supported by transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing BBR under the control of the 35S-promoter that resulted in an altered growth and development similar to what one would expect for misexpressed homeotic genes.Binding studies revealed that an essential GA/TC-dinucleotide rich sequence in the promoter of the INNER NO OUTER (INO) gene from Arabidopsis can be targeted by members of this transcription factor family, here named Basic Pentacysteine (BPC) proteins (Meister et al., 2003). Although the protein-family was first named BBR, it was proposed to refer to this family as the BBR/BPC-family of GAGA-binding transcription factors, since BPC gives important additional information to its name. So far, all functionally characterized BBR/BPC-proteins are ubiquously expressed in all tissues or developmental stages and do localize to the nucleus (Santi et al.,2003; Meister et al., 2003). Recently, Kooiker et al. (2005) found that two BBR/BPC-family members are involved in the expressional regulation of the homeotic MADS-box gene SEEDSTICK (STK)."
Orphans,Orphans,TF,"There are transcription factors that don't belong to any of the other families, thus called orphans. As related transcription factors are identified, they will be assigned to new families."
TUB,TUB,TF,"Tubby-like TF Family (TLP)
<br>
<br>

The first member of this family was discovered in mice where a mutation in the tubby gene resulted in a phenotype of delayed-onset obesity, sensorineural hearing loss and retinal degeneration (Kleyn et al., 1996). Other related genes have usually been named Tubby-like proteins (TLPs or TULPs). TULPs share a common alpha helix +beta sheet protein structure whereby a 12-beta-stranded barrel surrounds a central alpha helix. They are latent cytoplasmic factors whereby the inactive form resides in the cytoplasm, but, when activated, is translocated into the nucleus. Plants appear to possess more tubby-like genes than animals, but their functions are largely unclear except that a few studies have shown that they are involved in stress responses (Wang et al., 2018). In Arabidopsis, there is evidence that the AtTLP2 protein is translocated into the nucleus by interacting with Nuclear Factor Y subunit C3 (NF-YC3) to function as a transcription factor. RNA-sequence and transactivation assays revealed that TLP2 could activate the UDP-glucose 4-epimerase 1 gene (UGE1) (Wang et al., 2019). A more recent study indicates that the CsTLP8 tubby-like protein from cucumber, acts in the ABA signaling pathway and negatively regulates osmotic stresses tolerance during seed germination (Li et al 2021). In cotton, the GhTULP34 protein has been shown to interact with GhSKP1A, a subunit of the SCF-type complex, to form a functional SCF-type E3 ligase, and then participates in the response to negative regulation of osmotic stress during seed germination and seedling growth (Li et al., 2021). A genome wide survey of the maize genome revealed a total of 15 TLP genes (ZmTLP1–15). This family was classified into four subfamilies based on phylogenetic relationships, protein domains, and motif organization. Gene duplication and chromosomal location analysis indicated that segmental duplication has played a major role in the expansion of the maize TLP family. The ZmTLP genes exhibited differential expression profiles under ABA, NaCl, 42, 4 °C, and PEG stress treatment (Yulong et al., 2015).

GeBP,GBP,TF,"Trichomes of Arabidopsis are single-celled epidermal hair that are a useful model for studying plant cell fate determination. Trichome initiation requires the activity of the GLABROUS1 (GL1) gene whose expression in epidermal and trichome cells is dependent on the presence of a 3'-cis-regulatory element. Using a one-hybrid screen, we have isolated a cDNA, which encodes for a protein, GL1 enhancer binding protein (GeBP), that binds this regulatory element in yeast and in vitro. GeBP and its three homologues in Arabidopsis share two regions: a central region with no known motifs and a C-terminal region with a putative leucine-zipper motif. We show that both regions are necessary for trans-activation in yeast. A translational fusion with the Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) indicates that GeBP is a nuclear protein whose localization is restricted to, on average, 3-5 subnuclear foci that might correspond to nucleoli. Transcriptional fusion with the GUS reporter indicates that GeBP is mainly expressed in vegetative meristematic tissues and in very young leaf primordia. We looked at GeBP expression in plants mutated in or misexpressing KNAT1, a KNOX gene, expressed in the shoot apical meristem and downregulated in leaf founder cells, and found that GeBP transcript level is regulated by KNAT1 suggesting that KNAT1 is a transcriptional activator of GeBP. This regulation suggests that GeBP is acting as a repressor of leaf cell fate."
REM,,TF,"We have isolated and characterized AtREM1, the Arabidopsis ortholog of the cauliflower (Brassica oleracea) BoREM1. AtREM1 belongs to a large gene family of more than 20 members in Arabidopsis. The deduced AtREM1 protein contains several repeats of a B3-related domain, and it could represent a new class of regulatory proteins only found in plants. Expression of AtREM1 is developmentally regulated, being first localized in a few central cells of vegetative apical meristems, and later expanding to the whole inflorescence meristem, as well as primordia and organs of third and fourth floral whorls. This specific expression pattern suggests a role in the organization of reproductive meristems, as well as during flower organ development."
Homeobox,HB,TF,"We have isolated the Arabidopsis thaliana homeobox gene Athb-12, determined its structure and activation domain, demonstrated that its promoter is inducible in response to abscisic acid (ABA) treatment, and characterized the cellular distribution of its transcripts. The single intron of the gene interrupted the leucine-zipper domain region. The 5' regulatory region of Athb-12 can drive beta-glucuronidase (GUS) expression in tobacco transgenic plants. Athb-12 gene expression was further examined using in situ hybridization to determine the cellular distribution of Athb-12 transcripts during ABA induction. A complex pattern of Athb-12 expression was observed, often associated with regions of developing vascular tissues. Analysis of chimeras constructed from Athb-12 and the DNA-binding domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor GAL4 revealed that the activation domain of Athb-12 lies in the C-terminal region (amino acids 180 to 235). Taken together, our data suggest that Athb-12 is a transcriptional activator important in regulating certain developmental processes as well as in the plant's response to water stress involving ABA-mediated gene expression.

HRT,HRT,TF,"A barley gene encoding a novel DNA-binding protein (HRT) was identified by southwestern screening with baits containing a gibberellin phytohormone response element from an &alpha;-amylase promoter. Zinc and DNA binding assays demonstrate that HRT contains three unusual zinc fingers with a CX 8???????�?9CX 10CX 2H consensus sequence. In vivo, functional tests in plant cells indicate that full-length HRT can repress expression from certain promoters including the Amy1/6-4 andAmy2/32 &alpha;-amylase promoters. In contrast, truncated forms of HRT containing DNA-binding domains can activate, or derepress, transcription from these promoters. Database analysis identifies two genes similar to HRT in Arabidopsis thaliana and Vicia faba (PMID:9722564)."
AP2/ERF-ERF,EREB,TF,AP2 (APETALA2) and EREBPs (ethylene-responsive element binding proteins) are the prototypic members of a family of transcription factors unique to plants whose distinguishing characteristic is that they contain the so-called AP2 DNA-binding domain. AP2-EREBP genes form a large multigene family and they play a variety of roles throughout the plant life cycle: from being key regulators of several developmental processes like floral organ identity determination or control of leaf epidermal cell identity to forming part of the mechanisms used by plants to respond to various types of biotic and environmental stress. The molecular and biochemical characteristics of the AP2-EREBP transcription factors and their diverse functions are reviewed here and this multigene family is analyzed within the context of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence project.
ARF,ARF,TF,Auxin response factors or ARFs are a recently discovered family of transcription factors that bind with specificity to auxin response elements (AuxREs) in promoters of primary or early auxin-responsive genes. ARFs have an amino-terminal DNA-binding domain related to the carboxyl-terminal DNA-binding domain in the maize transactivator VIVIPAROUS1. All but one ARF identified to date contain a carboxyl-terminal protein-protein interaction domain that forms a putative amphipathic alpha-helix. A similar carboxyl-terminal protein-protein interaction domain is found in the Aux/IAA class of auxin-inducible proteins. Some ARFs contain transcriptional activation domains while others contain repression domains. ARFs appear to play a pivotal role in auxin-regulated gene expression of primary response genes.
BTB+TAZ,BT,TF,"BT proteins are a Calmodulin binding protein, of which Arabidopsis thaliana has 5. There are homologues in rice as well, but not in animals, suggesting plant specificity. They all have an N-terminal BTB domain, a central zf-TAZ domain, and a C-terminal Calmodulin binding domain . AtBT1 has been shown to interact in vitro with AtBET9 and atBET10, members of the fsh/Ring3 class of transcriptional regulators. AtBT expression is affected by a variety of hormones, nutrients, and stresses, such as H202, Ca2+, and SA (PMID:19525324). AtBTs are thus part of a signal transduction network involved in gene regulation in response to multiple signals, but their exact place in this network, as well as many of the interaction partners that must make up such a broad array of responses have yet to be elucidated (PMID:15316289)."
FLO/LFY,LFY,TF,"LEAFY (LFY) is found in all land plants. The FLO/LFY family of transcription factors act as floral meristem identity genes that have roles in controlling homeotic genes that are separable from their roles in specifying floral fate, though the molecular mechanisms behind this have yet to be described(PMID:9783581). Their role in angiosperms is of course distinct from their role in other plants. The proteins are remarkably well conserved with two blocks of similarity, in the N- and C-terminal regions. It has been described that LFY directly regulates the transcription of the AP1-related (APETALA 1) gene CAL and of at least five additional genes by binding to the consensus CCANTG LFY-binding motif. Three of these genes encode putative transcription factors, and two of these genes encode putative signaling molecules, which control later processes in floral development (PMID:14736918)."
C2H2,C2H,TF,C2H2 zinc-finger proteins play important roles in plant development including floral organogenesis leaf initiation lateral shoot initiation gametogenesis and seed development. The gene for one such protein from Arabidopsis AtZFP1 (Arabidopsis thaliana zinc-finger protein 1) is expressed at high levels in the shoot apex including the apical meristem developing leaves and the developing vascular system. In light-grown seedlings AtZFP1 expression is induced about three days after germination before the expansion of the true leaves. Dark-grown plants in which photomorphogenesis is repressed have no detectable AtZFP1 expression in the shoot apex. Under conditions which induce or mimic photomorphogenic development including growth in the light shifting dark-grown plants to continuous light or growth on cytokinin in the dark high levels of AtZFP1 expression are detected. Furthermore AtZFP1 expression does not depend on active photosynthesis as shown by analysis of plants grown on the carotenoid biosynthetic inhibitor norflurazon. These results are discussed in relation to a possible role for AtZFP1 in shoot development downstream of photomorphogenic activation.
CSD,CSD,TF,"Cold shock domains (CSD) are proteins that help acclimate cells to colder growth conditions. The CSD is among the most ancient and well conserved nucleic acid binding domains, shown in prokaryotes, higher plants, and animals. Plant CSD homologues typically contain two distinct nucleic acid-binding modules, a single N-terminal CSD and variable quantities of C-terminal CCHC zinc fingers, which are interspersed by glycine-rich regions, and have been shown to bind ssDNA, dsDNA, and ssRNA. Members have been shown to function as RNA chaperones that facilitate translation at lower temperatures by preventing the secondary structure formation that can occur in mRNA at lower temperatures. Wheat cold shock protein 1 (WCSP1) has been shown to suppress transcription termination at low temperatures, as well as melt DNA to ensure efficient transcription at low temperatures (PMID:16788067; PMID:20060550)."
DBP,DBP,TF,"DNA binding protein phosphatase (DBP) is a highly conserved plant motif involved in sequence-specific DNA binding. These factors all have a PP2C (protein phosphatase 2C class) C-terminal catalytic domain and sequence alignment of the N-terminal region of the identified DBP-like factors describes the existence of a conserved domain, comprising a motif almost invariant in all the aligned sequences from all angiosperms, characterized by an N-terminal core F(L,V)PX(L,V,I)RSGXWSD DNA-binding motif. Sequences within the very N-terminus are more divergent, but do keep significant similarity within taxa, and might confer functional specificity. The phosphatase activity of these transcription factors enables cells to rapidly and reversibly modulate transcription factor function in response to signaling stimuli (PMID:15710688)."
C2C2-Dof,DOF,TF,Dof proteins are members of a major family of plant transcription factors. The proteins have similar DNA-binding properties because of the highly conserved DNA-binding domain. However recent studies are disclosing their diverse roles in gene expression when associated with plant-specific phenomena including light phytohormone and defense responses seed development and germination. Based on the structural diversity indicated by the complete catalog of Arabidopsis Dof proteins Dof genes appear to have evolved multiple times preceding and paralleling the diversification of angiosperms. Such gene multiplication might have led to the functional diversification of Dof proteins proceeding differently in distinct plant species.
FAR1-like,FARL,TF,"FHY3 (far red elongated hypocotyl) and FAR1 (Far red-impaired response) are transcription factors that have separable DNA binding and transcriptional activation domains that are highly conserved in Mutator-like transposases, act as transcription factors essential for activating the expression by directly binding to a CACGCGC motif present in the promoters of FHY1 and FHL (for FHY1-like), whose products are required for light-induced phytochrome A nuclear accumulation and subsequent light responses. FHY3, FAR1, and Mutator-like transposases also share a similar domain structure, including an N-terminal C2H2 zinc finger domain, a central putative core transposase domain, and a C-terminal SWIM motif (named after SWI2/SNF and MuDR transposases, of the sequence CxCxnCXH, where x stands for any amino acid residue). The N-terminal C2H2 domain has been shown to be involved in direct DNA-binding, while the transposase domain and C-terminal SWIM motif are required for transcriptional activity (PMID:18715961)."
GIF,,TF,"GRF-interacting  factor (GIF) was identified in a search for interacting partners of the Arabidopsis thaliana growth-regulating factor (AtGRF) gene family. Sequence and molecular analysis showed that GIF1 is a functional homolog of the human SYT transcription coactivator. It has been proposed that GIF1 is a coactivator of the transcriptional activator GRF1, and they are part of a complex involved in regulating the growth and shape of leaves and petals (PMID:15326298)."
HMG,HMG,coregulators,"High mobility group proteins are proteins with an HMG-box domain that binds kinked or unwound DNA in a sequence non-specific way with high affinity.  The HMG-box structure contains three alpha-helices separated by loops. HMG proteins contain two DNA-binding HMG-box domains that show structural and functional differences, as well as a long, acidic C-terminal domain rich in aspartic and glutamic acid residues. The HMG-box domain can be found in a wide variety of proteins serving many biological purposes, such as DNA repair, transcription, and recombination (PMID:19236006;19360789)."
bZIP,bZIP,TF,In plants basic region/leucine zipper motif (bZIP) transcription factors regulate processes including pathogen defence light and stress signalling seed maturation and flower development. The Arabidopsis genome sequence contains 75 distinct members of the bZIP family of which approximately 50 are not described in the literature. Using common domains the AtbZIP family can be subdivided into ten groups. Here we review the available data on bZIP functions in the context of subgroup membership and discuss the interacting proteins. This integration is essential for a complete functional characterization of bZIP transcription factors in plants and to identify functional redundancies among AtbZIP factors.
C2C2-YABBY,YAB,TF,Lateral organs produced by shoot apical and flower meristems exhibit a fundamental abaxial-adaxial asymmetry. We describe three members of the YABBY gene family FILAMENTOUS FLOWER YABBY2 and YABBY3 isolated on the basis of homology to CRABS CLAW. Each of these genes is expressed in a polar manner in all lateral organ primordia produced from the apical and flower meristems. The expression of these genes is precisely correlated with abaxial cell fate in mutants in which abaxial cell fates are found ectopically reduced or eliminated. Ectopic expression of either FILAMENTOUS FLOWER or YABBY3 is sufficient to specify the development of ectopic abaxial tissues in lateral organs. Conversely loss of polar expression of these two genes results in a loss of polar differentiation of tissues in lateral organs. Taken together these observations indicate that members of this gene family are responsible for the specification of abaxial cell fate in lateral organs of Arabidopsis. Furthermore ectopic expression studies suggest that ubiquitous abaxial cell fate and maintenance of a functional apical meristem are incompatible.
LEUNIG,LUG,coregulators,"LEUNIG is an Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptional co-repressor that regulates the floral homeotic gene AGAMOUS (PMID:11058164). It is a member of the GroTLE family of transcriptional co-repressors, which do not possess DNA binding motifs but repress a diverse number of target genes through targeted recruitment by site-specific DNA binding transcription factors. LUENIG accomplishes binding to site specific DNA binding trancription factors by using an adaptor protein, SEUSS (SEU). These corepressors affect this repression by interaction with A.t. Mediatior components AtMED19/SWP and AtCDK8/HEN3, as well as interaction with histone de-acetylase 19 (HDA19) (PMID:17526732)."
RBR,RB,coregulators,"Retinoblastoma related protein is a key negative regulator of cell division in metazoans. In plants, it controls the transition in the cell cycle from G1 to S phase, by repressing E2F transcription factors (PMID:15201912). This pRB:E2F cycle is present in all higher plants. RNAi experiments have demonstrated that RBR is a key cell cycle regulator required for coordination of cell division, differentiation, and cell homeostasis (PMID:20525851)."
C2C2-GATA,GATA,TF,Many light-responsive promoters contain GATA motifs and a number of nuclear proteins have been defined that interact with these elements. Type-IV zinc-finger proteins have been extensively characterised in animals and fungi and are referred to as GATA factors by virtue of their affinity for promoter elements containing this sequence. We previously identified cDNA sequences representing four Arabidopsis thaliana type-TV zinc-finger proteins. Here we define the organisation and expression of GATA-1 GATA-2 GATA-3 and GATA-4 as well as DNA-binding characteristics of their encoded proteins. Transcripts from all four genes can be detected in all tissues examined suggesting that they are not developmentally regulated at the level of transcription. In vitro binding experiments with Escherichia coli-derived recombinant proteins were performed using motifs previously defined as targets for nuclear GATA-binding proteins. These studies reveal differences in DNA binding specificity of GATA-1 as compared to the other three proteins. In vivo protein-DNA interactions monitored by yeast one-hybrid assays reveal different binding characteristics as compared to those defined with E. coli-derived recombinant protein. Trans-activation of gene expression by the four Arabidopsis proteins via some but not all DNA elements tested indicates that the Arabidopsis proteins can form functional interactions with previously defined promoter elements containing GATA motifs. We conclude that the Arabidopsis type-IV zinc-finger proteins may represent the previously defined family of nuclear GATA-binding proteins implicated in light-responsive transcription.
MED6,MED6,coregulators,"MED6 is an essential for viability component of the head module of the yeast mediator complex. It is involved in bridging between the head and tail modules of mediator. A mutation of MED6 in yeast abolished activation of transcription of 5 inducible promoters in vivo, but this mutation had no effect on uninduced transcription, transcription of constitutively expressed genes, or transcription by RNA polymerases I and III (PMID:9234719). MED6 specifically interacts with Srb4, and this interaction is a requirement for transcriptional regulation of the RNA pol II holoenzyme (PMID:9710620)."
Sigma70-like,SIG,TF,"Members of the sigma70 family of sigma factors are components of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme that direct bacterial or plastid core RNA polymerase to specific promoter elements that are situated 10 and 35 base-pairs upstream of transcription-initiation points (PMID:12540296). Plant plastidal sigma factors are encoded in the nuclear genomes of higher plants, and have an N-terminal transit peptide of 30-60 amino acids for transit through the cytoplasm to the  that is cleaved off after delivery into the chloroplast. Plant sigma factors contain a region, essential for transcription, that putatively binds DNA non-template strand downstream -10 box in a sequence specific manner, another DNA binding region that participates in promoter melting without a template, and a region that binds to template strand near ?10 element of promoter. Plant sigma factors are well described in the literature, and there is evidence that they are all expressed and not pseudogenes (PMID:17356883)."
MBF1,MBF,coregulators,"Multiprotein bridging factor is a transcriptional co-activator that mediates transcriptional activation by bridging the gap between an activator and a TATA-box binding protein (TBP). AtMBFs share similar biological functions, but have distinct roles in various tissues and conditions (PMID:14988493)."
MYB,MYB,TF,"MYB factors represent a very large and diverse gene family where proteins with two MYB repeats (R2R3, each 50 aa long) are the most common ones, but proteins with just one repeat can be found, too.  Each motif consists of three alpha-helices, where the second and third form a helix-turn-helix structure, and the third helix is thought to make contact with the major groove of DNA.  Three tryptophan residues in each repeat, spaced by 18-21 aa, form a very conserved cluster among all MYB factors.  Compared to the highly conserved MYB domain, other regions in MYB proteins can be highly variable.  Today, more than 200 MYB factors are identified in maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa) and a comparably high number in other related monocots.  Structurally and functionally very diverse MYB factors can be involved in the control of mainly plant specific processes such as plant secondary metabolism, cell morphogenesis or cell fate.  Classical MYB factors, which are related to c-Myb, seem to be involved in the control of the cell cycle in animals, plants and other higher eukaryotes."

OVATE,OFP,TF,"Ovate family proteins are a family of transcriptional repressors, shown to be at work in multiple cellular processes in a variety of flowering plants. OFPs are characterized by an OVATE domain, a roughly 70 AA C-terminal domain first characterised in tomato. There are 18 AtOFPs, but only 4 have been shown to regulate growth, in various ways such as regulation of cell elongation, gibberellins biosynthesis, and secondary cell wall formation (PMID:21886836)."
"p15 (PC4,Sub1)",KELP,coregulators,"p15 mediates the effects of several distinct activators on transcription in vitro in mammals. Functional deletion analyses revealed a bipartite structure of p15 comprising an amino-terminal regulatory domain and a carboxy-terminal cryptic DNA-binding domain. The activity of p15 is controlled by protein kinases that target the regulatory domain. Structural and functional similarities, including sequence homology to domains essential for cofactor function, cofactor activity, promiscuity with respect to transcriptional activators, and interactions with components of the basal transcription machinery, relate this novel cellular cofactor to viral immediate-early transcriptional regulators (PMID:8062392). The protein has ssDNA binding activity, and has been shown to recruit to induced DNA damage sites. It is involved in the initial steps of the response of mammalian cells to DNA damage, and may facilitate subsequent steps in DNA repair (PMID:19047459)."
PLATZ,PLATZ,TF,"Plant AT-rich sequence- and zinc-binding protein 1 (PLATZ1), is the first member to be isolated of a class of zinc dependent DNA binding proteins. PLATZ1 was isolated from pea cDNA and has significant homology to several predicted proteins from the genomes of other plants, that yet remain uncharacterized. Multiple alignments among these paralogous proteins show that several cysteine and histidine residues are invariant in two distant regions on the protein, C-x(2)-H-x(11)-C-x(2)-C-x((4-5))-C-x(2)-C-x((3-7))-H-x(2)-H and C-x(2)-C-x((10-11))-C-x(3)-C. Both regions have been described to be necessary for zinc-dependent DNA binding. PLATZ1 has been shown to nonspecifically bind AT-rich sequences, and is thought to repress transcription of AT-rich sequences (PMID:11600698)."
Rcd1-like,Rcd1L,TF,"Required cell differentiation 1 (RDC1) protein was initially defined to be essential for sex differentiation during nitrogen starvation in yeast. It encodes a 283 amino acid protein with no particular motifs (PMID:9447985). RCD1-like proteins have been identified in all branches of eukaryotes, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved sexual differentiation mechanism."
S1Fa-like,S1Fa,TF,"S1Fa was originally isolated from a spinach cDNA library as a cDNA encoding for a protein with specific binding activity for the tissue-specific negative cis-element S1F binding site of spinach rps1. The C-terminal contains a suggested NLS of the sequence (PPKKKK). The protein also contains a putative DNA-binding alpha helix (ISKKKMKRERLK). The mRNA accumulates in roots and etiolated seedlings more than in green leaves. The protein is well conserved across the proteomes of angiosperms, the authors posit this could describe a new class of plant transcription factors (PMID:7739894)."
SHI/STY (SRS),SRS,TF,"SHORTINTERNODE/STYLISH proteins are a highly redundant family of transcriptional activators targeting genes that mediate auxin biosynthesis. AtSTY1 interacts with a promoter element ACTCTA(C/A) in several genes related to auxin biosynthesis, YUC4, YUC8, ORCA3, and ORA59.  Arabidopsis thaliana has nine members of the SHI/STY family that have a 43-amino acid RING-like zinc finger domain, and a more C-terminal domain, similar in size, the IGGH domain, which is responsible for intrafamily homo/hetero-dimerization that may be necessary for some of the proteins' functions (PMID:20154152)."
SNF2,SNF2,coregulators,"SNF2 is a yeast transcriptional activator protein, the first described of the SNF2 family, consisting of SNF2 and its homologs. All proteins in the family contain sequence motifs of significant similarity to the DNA and RNA helicase protein families (PMID:17526749). SNF2 is the ATPase component of the SWI/SNF2 chromatin remodelling complex, which utilises energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to disrupt histone-DNA interactions to allow transcriptional machinery access to DNA."
SWI/SNF-BAF60,BAF60,coregulators,"SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complexes consist of large multi-subunit complexes containing a Brm or Brg1 catalytic ATPase subunit and approximately 10 Brg/Brm associated factors (BAFs). BAF60s, which are found in most SWI/SNF complexes, are thought to bridge the gap between said complexes and transcription factors (PMID:20148946)."
SWI3B,SWI3B,coregulators,"SWI3B is an Arabidopsis thaliana homologue of yeast SWI3, a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex. It has been shown to interact with HAB1(hypersensitive to ABA 1), a protein that plays a key role as a negative regulator of ABA signaling. HAB1 modulates ABA response through its interaction with SWI3B and thus, the regulation of the SWI/SNF complex (PMID:19033529)."
Nin-like,,TF,"Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing root nodules on legumes are founded by root cortical cells that de-differentiate and restart cell division to establish nodule primordia. Bacterial microsymbionts invade these primordia through infection threads laid down by the plant and, after endocytosis, membrane-enclosed bacteroids occupy cells in the nitrogen-fixing tissue of functional nodules. Lipochitin oligosaccharides that are excreted by the nitrogen fixing bacteria trigger the development of root nodules, but development can be supressed by the plant. Nodule Inception (NIN) was originally identified in Lotus japonicus. NIN is required for formation of infection threads and the initiation of primordia. NIN protein has regional similarity to transcription factors, and the predicted DNA-binding/dimerization domain identifies and typifies a consensus motif conserved in plant proteins with a function in nitrogen-controlled development (PMID:10647012)."
ABI3-VP1,ABI,TF,"The VIVIPAROUS (VP1) gene from Zea mays, was the first gene identified with the B3 DNA binding domain, and it, along with its Arabidopsis thaliana ortholog ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3). The B3 binding domain present in this family recognizes the Sph/RY element of the CATGCA sequence. Members of this family are involved in the abscisic acid signal transduction pathway, and are involved in seed development, maturation, and germination (PMID:7590227)(PMID:19478073)."
Alfin-like,ALF,TF,"The Alfin1-like family is first described by its founding member, Alfin1. The cDNA of Alfin1 was obtained by differential screening of a poly(A)+ library from salt-tolerant alfalfa cells, which encodes a protein with a Cys4 and His/Cys3 putative zinc-binding domain. The putative consensus binding site for Alfin1 is shown to contain two to five G-rich triplets with the conserved core of GNGGTG or GTGGNG (PMID:9869418). Alfin1-binding sites occur in promoters of genes expressed in roots of a wide variety of plant species. Overexpression of Alfin1 in transgenic alfalfa plants driven by the CaMV 35S promoter confers a many-fold increase in root growth under normal and saline conditions and does not adversely affect shoot growth (PMID:10750899). More recent research has purported that the zinc finger motif in Alfin1 is actually a canonical plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, which has not been implicated in DNA binding in other proteins thus far. Further studies are needed to determine whether Alfin1 binds to DNA through the PHD finger or via another unidentified motif. Alfin1-like proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana have been shown to localize to the nucleus and bind to H3K4me3/2 via plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers (PMID:19154204)."
CHROMO domain,,coregulators,"The Chromatin Organization Modifier domain is a conserved region of 60 amino acids. The chromodomain fold - three beta strands packed against a C-terminal alpha helix - mediates protein-protein and/or protein-nucleic acid interactions (PMID:22285924). There are three classes of chromodomain proteins: proteins with an N-terminal chromodomain and a structurally similar C-terminal chromo shadow domain; proteins with a single chromodomain; and proteins with paired tandem chromodomains. Many chromodomain proteins alter euchromatin, the actively transcribed form, to heterochromatin, the silenced form. Polycomb group proteins are an example of this (PMID:1982376)."
ARID,ARID,TF,"The ARID family of DNA binding proteins are characterized by the presence of an AT-rich interactive domain (ARID) which bind AT-rich DNA sequences in a not necessarily sequence specific fashion. The consensus sequence occurs in proteins from all sequenced eukaryotic organisms. The basic structure of the domain appears to be a series of six helices separated by &szlig;-strands, loops, or turns, but the structured region may extend to an additional helix at either or both ends of the basic six. Most ARID family members have not been characterized with respect to their DNA-binding behavior, but it is already apparent that not all ARIDs conform to the pattern of binding AT-rich sequences. The ARID family is subdivided into 7 distinct families based on sequence identity among members (PMID:11959810). Five out of the 7 ARID families bind DNA without sequence specificity (PMC:546134)."
bHLH,bHLH,TF,The basic/helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins are a superfamily of transcription factors that bind as dimers to specific DNA target sites and that have been wellcharacterized in nonplant eukaryotes as important regulatory components in diverse biological processes. Based on evidence that the bHLH protein PIF3 is a direct phytochrome reaction partner in the photoreceptor signaling network we have undertaken a comprehensive computational analysis of the Arabidopsis genome sequence databases to define the scope and features of the bHLH family. Using a set of criteria derived from a previously defined consensus motif we identified 147 bHLH protein-encoding genes making this one of the largest transcription factor families in Arabidopsis. Phylogenetic analysis of the bHLH domain sequences permits classification of these genes into 21 subfamilies. The evolutionary and potential functional relationships implied by this analysis are supported by other criteria including the chromosomal distribution of these genes relative to duplicated genome segments the conservation of variant exon/intron structural patterns and the predicted DNA binding activities within subfamilies. Considerable diversity in DNA binding site specificity among family members is predicted and marked divergence in protein sequence outside of the conserved bHLH domain is observed. Together with the established propensity of bHLH factors to engage in varying degrees of homodimerization and heterodimerization these observations suggest that the Arabidopsis bHLH proteins have the potential to participate in an extensive set of combinatorial interactions endowing them with the capacity to be involved in the regulation of a multiplicity of transcriptional programs. We provide evidence from yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays that two related phytochrome-interacting members in the Arabidopsis family PIF3 and PIF4 can form both homodimers and heterodimers and that all three dimeric configurations can bind specifically to the G-box DNA sequence motif CACGTG. These data are consistent in principle with the operation of this combinatorial mechanism in Arabidopsis.
BSD,BSD,coregulators,"The BSD domain is an average of 60 amino acids, characterized by three predicted alpha helices, which probably form a three-helical bundle, as well as by conserved tryptophan and phenylalanine residues, located at the C terminus of the domain. It is found preceding BTB domains, a protein protein interaction domain often found in transcription factors, suggesting a possible DNA binding role (PMID:119435360) as well as U-box domains (PMID:119435360, PMID:15772280). The BSD domain was first identified by a computational analysis in the BTF2-like transcription factor (Yeast), synapse-associated (Drosophila) and DOS2-like (Yeast) proteins, more recently, in Arabidopsis, the N-terminus region of the AtBSD1 protein has been proposed as a transcriptional activator after a yeast transcriptional activity assay (Park, J et al., 2009)."
CCAAT-HAP2,CA2P,TF,The CCAAT motif is found in the promoters of many eukaryotic genes. In yeast a single complex of three proteins termed HAP2 HAP3 and HAP5 binds to this sequence and in mammals the three components of the equivalent complex (called variously NF-Y CBF or CP1) are also represented by single genes. Here we report the presence of multiple genes for each of the components of the CCAAT-binding complex HAP2 35 from Arabidopsis. Three independent Arabidopsis HAP subunit 2 (AtHAP2) cDNAs were cloned by functional complementation of a yeast hap2 mutant and two independent forms each of AtHAP3 and AtHAP5 cDNAs were detected in the expressed sequence tag database. Additional homologs (two of AtHAP3 and one of AtHAP5) have been identified from available Arabidopsis genomic sequences. Northern-blot analysis indicated ubiquitous expression for each AtHAP2 and AtHAP5 cDNA in a range of tissues whereas expression of each AtHAP3 cDNA was under developmental and/or environmental regulation. The unexpected presence of multiple forms of each HAP homolog in Arabidopsis compared with the single genes in yeast and vertebrates suggests that the HAP235 complex may play diverse roles in gene transcription in higher plants.

C3H,C3H,TF,"The CCCH (C3H) zinc finger motif is a nucleic acid binding motif that is described in proteins with diverse functions in many different pathways in plants. A typical CCCH protein usually contains 1-6 CCCH-type zinc finger motifs. Based on the different numbers of amino acid spacers between cysteines and histidines in the CCCH motif, a consensus sequence for these motifs was defined as C-X4-15-C-X4-6-C-X3-H (X represents any amino acid) based on the whole-genome analysis of rice and Arabidopsis CCCH proteins. The domain has been shown in proteins that bind to single stranded DNA and RNA (PMC:3391233)."
Ultrapetala,ULT,coregulators,"The establishment of floral organs is an event that occurs late in plant development. Thus, genes required for establishing floral meristems must be repressed during vegetative growth. In plants, maintaining the appropriate transcriptional status of these genes is accomplished by the antagonistic activities of Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (trxG) protein complexes. PcG protein complexes maintain the de facto repressed state of genes unnecessary during vegetative growth, such as floral genes. trxG complexes counteract this repressivity to allow expression of the repressed genes.  In Arabidopsis thaliana ULTRAPETALA1 (ULT1) is a trxG factor necessary to end stem cell activity in floral meristems by the activation of the MADS-box, floral homeotic gene AGAMOUS (AG). It accomplishes this by counteracting the deposition of repressive histone trimethylation in the promoter and an intron of the AG locus by the PcG protein, CURLYLEAF (CLF) (PMID:19952107)."
C2C2-CO-like,COL,TF,The CO (CONSTANS) gene of Arabidopsis has an important role in the regulation of flowering by photoperiod. CO is part of a gene family with 17 members that are subdivided into three classes termed Group I to III here. All members of the family have a CCT (CO CO-like TOC1) domain near the carboxy terminus. Group I genes which include CO have two zinc finger B-boxes near the amino terminus. Group II genes have one B-box and Group III genes have one B-box and a second diverged zinc finger. Analysis of rice (Oryza sativa) genomic sequence identified 16 genes (OsA-OsP) that were also divided into these three groups showing that their evolution predates monocot/dicot divergence. Eight Group I genes (HvCO1-HvCO8) were isolated from barley (Hordeum vulgare) of which two (HvCO1 and HvCO2) were highly CO like. HvCO3 and its rice counterpart (OsB) had one B-box that was distantly related to Group II genes and was probably derived by internal deletion of a two B-box Group I gene. Sequence homology and comparative mapping showed that HvCO1 was the counterpart of OsA (Hd1) a major determinant of photoperiod sensitivity in rice. Major genes determining photoperiod response have been mapped in barley and wheat (Triticum aestivum) but none corresponded to CO-like genes. Thus selection for variation in photoperiod response has affected different genes in rice and temperate cereals. The peptides of HvCO1 HvCO2 (barley) and Hd1 (rice) show significant structural differences from CO particularly amino acid changes that are predicted to abolish B-box2 function suggesting an evolutionary trend toward a one-B-box structure in the most CO-like cereal genes.
CPP,CPP,TF,"The completion of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence allows a comparative analysis of transcriptional regulators across the three eukaryotic kingdoms. Arabidopsis dedicates over 5% of its genome to code for more than 1500 transcription factors, about 45% of which are from families specific to plants. Arabidopsis transcription factors that belong to families common to all eukaryotes do not share significant similarity with those of the other kingdoms beyond the conserved DNA binding domains, many of which have been arranged in combinations specific to each lineage. The genome-wide comparison reveals the evolutionary generation of diversity in the regulation of transcription."
CXC,CXC,coregulators,"The CXC domain is a cystine rich motif consisting of C-X-C-X4-C-X3-YC-X-C-X6-C-X3-C-X-C-X2-C (PMID:10191092). Arabidopsis TSO1 and its homologs are nuclear proteins containing two of these motifs. TSO1 is a regulator of cytokinesis and cell development in Arabidopsis, though how it accomplishes this regulation of directional control is as of yet unknown (PMID:10769245)."
PcG,,TF,"The first genes composing the Polycomb group (PcG) were identified 50 years ago in Drosophila melanogaster as essential developmental functions that regulate the correct segmental expression of homeotic selector genes. In the past two decades, what was initially described as a large family of chromatin-associated proteins involved in the maintenance of transcriptional repression to maintain cellular memory of homeotic genes, turned out to be a highly conserved and sophisticated network of epigenetic regulators that play key roles in multiple aspects of cell physiology and identity, including regulation of developmental genes, cell differentiation, stem and somatic cell reprogramming and response to environmental stimuli. Recent studies in plants have shown that PcG proteins regulate diverse developmental processes and, as in animals, they affect both homeotic gene expression and cell proliferation (PMID:12524010,22994356)."
DDT,DDT,coregulators,"The DDT family consists of members containing the DDT domain, a likely DNA binding domain. It consists of conserved N terminal phenylalanines, as well as conserved C terminal leucines. The putative protein-protein interaction motif of this domain is not conserved (PMID:11246006)."
MED7,MED7,coregulators,"The Mediator of transcriptional regulation was first characterized in yeast and is the central coactivator that enables a response of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to activators and repressors. MED7, a component of the middle module of Mediator, has been shown to serve as a binding platform, with its C-terminus associated with MED21, and its N-terminus associated with MED31. The middle module subunits MED1 and MED10, which bridge to the Mediator tail module, also bind MED7 (PMID:20123732). Crystal structure analysis of the MED7/MED21 heterodimer showed a four helix bundle domain, and a coiled-coil protrusion connected by a flexible hinge. Four putative protein binding sites allow for assembly of the middle module and binding of MED6, which bridges to the Mediator head module. This flexible bridge could account for changes in Mediator conformation upon binding to RNA pol II or activators/repressors. (PMID:15710619). The N-terminal MED7/MED31 submodule shows a conserved novel fold, two proline-rich stretches in the N-terminus of MED7 wrapping around the right-handed four-helix bundle of Med31 (PMID:19057509)."
SET,SET,coregulators,"The methylation of lysine residues on histone tails, a histone modification associated with gene activation and silencing, is carried out by proteins containing a conserved catalytic SET domain. The SET domain consists of two non-contiguous regions formed by N- and C-terminal ends of the primary sequence, each region contains three-to-four short ??????-strands, a short helix and several loops that connect these secondary structural elements. The C-terminal end forms a topologically unusual and highly conserved knot-like structure in which a strand threads through a loop region (PMID:12575990)."
mTERF,MTERF,TF,"The mitochondrial termination factor family (mTERF) were thought in animal models to be comprised of DNA-binding regulators of mitochondrial transcription.More recently, they have been recognized as important players in organellar gene expression not necessarily acting as transcription factors,but rather blocking transcription acting in antisense or by playing a role in ribosomal biogenesis (PMID:25582570). Angiosperms have the highest number of mTERFs out of all eukaryotes and expansion of the family has been proposed to be important to the evolution of land plants (PMID:23087700).For instance, Arabidopsis thaliana has 35 mTERF proteins, 17 of which are mitochondrial targeted, 11 of which are chloroplastic,and 1 that was localized in the cytoplasm (PMID:21464319).Molecular mechanisms for mTERFs action in plants is not yet fully understood, but for few mTERFs (two in Arabidopsis and one in Maize) a molecular function as splicing factors have been characterized (one in chloroplasts ZmMTERF4, encoded by the gene GRMZM2G029933; and two in mitochondria AtMTERF4 and AtMTERF15, encoded by the genes At4g02990 and At1g74120 respectively) (PMID:24500208) (PMID:25402171)."
LBD,LBD,TF,"The plant-specific LBD (Lateral Organ Boundaries Domain) gene family is essential in the regulation of plant lateral organ development and are involved in almost all aspects of plant development, including embryo, root, leaf, and inflorescence development, as the regulation of anthocyanin and nitrogen metabolism. These genes participate in the definition of the boundary that separates lateral organs from adjacent tissue. LBD proteins contain a characteristic LOB domain composed of a C-motif required for DNA-binding which contains four perfectly conserved cysteine (C) residues in a CX2CX6CX3C motif where X are residues that are not conserved, a conserved glycine residue, and a leucine-zipper-like sequence that includes five hydrophobic amino acids (valine, isoleucine, leucine) separated by six variable amino acid residues as a probable protein dimerization domain required for PPIs (protein protein interactions). Phylogenetic reconstructions of the Arabidopsis, rice and maize LBD genes suggest two major classes of LBD genes which are characterized by the presence (class I) or absence (class II) of functional leucine-zipper-like domains. The majority of LBD genes belong to class I. LOB domain proteins are suggested to act as transcription factors based on their nuclear localization and their capacity to bind to the DNA motif 5' GCGGCG 3' (PMID:20961800)."
PHD,PHD,coregulators,"The prototypical Plant Homeodomain finger (PHD) was first identified in 1993 as a 'Cys4HisCys3' zinc finger motif in the homeodomain protein HAT3.1 in Arabidopsis thaliana. Since then, dozens of PHD fingers have been reported to express histone-binding activities. The present data support one notion that the histone H3 N-terminal segment, notably the 'NH2-ARTKQTARK' motif is virtually the major target for most histone-binding PHD fingers. On the other hand, as discussed below, the 'readership' of each particular PHD finger is deliberately 'twisted' to interpret the message encoded by different histone post-translational modifications within the flexible histone N-terminal tails. PHD family proteins have been shown to act as readers for many different histone post translational modifications (PMID:22194011)."
R3H,R3H,TF,"The R3H motif binds single-stranded nucleic acids. Many members of the family are described in hypothetical proteins described in genome sequence databases. It is one of two RNA binding domains in Poly-A Ribonuclease (PARN), a eukaryotic mRNA decaying enzyme that functions by shortening the 3' Poly-A tails of mRNA molecules. Removal of the R3H domain from PARN results in a significant loss of stability (PMID:17624302).  Spectroscopic experiments suggested that the RRM domain might be structurally adjacent to the R3H domain, and thus provide a basis for the cooperative binding of poly(A) by the two RNA-binding domains (PMID:17391638)."
GNAT,HAG,coregulators,"The superfamily of GNC5 related N-acetyltransferases, also referred to as the GNATsuperfamily, is the superfamily of acetyltransferases that contains the histone
acetyltransferases (HATs). Histone acetyltranferase (HAT) enzymes are the catalytic subunit of large multisubunit HAT complexes that acetylate the epsilon-amino group of specific lysine residues on histone tails to promote transcriptional activation (PMID:11437231)."
ARR-B,ARR,TF,"Two-component systems have originally been found and functionally characterized in prokaryotes. Additionally, they emerged as important sensing/response mechanisms in higher plants. Generally, hybrid histidine kinases function as receptors for the incoming signals and the so-called 'response regulators' transmit this information via canonical His-to-Asp phosphorelay. Histidine containing phosphotransfer domain proteins exist in plants as a kind of shuttle mechanism, which can receive the phosphate residue from the upstream histidine kinases and transfer it to the response regulators. So far, there are 10 A-type ARRs (Arabidopsis Response Regulators) and 11 B-type ARR proteins known from Arabidopsis thaliana. While the A-type ARR ions likely via protein-protein interaction, B-type ARRs constitute a subfamily of the GARP-domain transcription factor family. The B-motif (GARP-like motif) comprises about 60 - 80 AS and has been shown to be responsible for binding to its DNA-binding consensus GAT. Besides these classical ARRs the APRR (Arabidopsis Pseudo response Regulator) family consists of several members of pseudo response regulators, where the phospho-accepting Asp (D) residue has been replaced by a Glu (E) in the receiver domain of these proteins. Thus, these atypical response regulator proteins might not necessarily be involved in a canonical His-to-Asp phosphorelay dependent pathway. Functionally the two-component systems in plants play a major role in cytokinin perception and signalling and contribute to ethylene signal transduction and osmosensing. Furthermore, developmental processes like megagametogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana and flowering promotion in rice (Oryza sativa) involve elements of two-component systems. Two-component-like elements also function as components of the Arabidopsis circadian clock. Because of the molecular mode of signalling, plant two-component systems also appear to serve as intensive cross talk and signal integration machinery."
ZF-HD,ZHD,TF,"ZF-HD proteins are a subfamily of Homeodomain proteins, consisting of 14 members in Arabidopsis. Most of these proteins do not contain an intrinsic activation domain, suggesting that interactions with other factors are required for transcriptional activation. In Arabidopsis, the family members are all expressed predominantly or exclusively in floral tissue, suggesting a regulatory role in floral development (PMID:16428600)."

IWS1/SPN1,IWS,coregulators,"Interact-with-SPT6 1 is a protein that was first characterized in yeast that was reported to be involved in postrecruitment of RNA-pol II mediated transcription. It is implicated in  transcriptional elongation in yeast, human, and arabidopsis by directly interacting with the transcriptional elongation factor spt6. In Arabidopsis thaliana, IWS1 is involved in brassinosteroid regulated gene expression, and has been shown to interact with the transcription factor family BES1, which is activated by the BR receptor. ChIP experiments have shown that IWS1 binding is enriched at both the promoter and transcribed regions of target genes. These findings suggest that IWS1 is recruited by BES1 to the promoters of BR-responsive gene promoters under BR-induced conditions (PMID:20139304)."
FHA,FHA,coregulators,"The forkhead-associated (FHA) domain is a small protein module shown to recognize phosphothreonine epitopes on proteins. It is present in a diverse range of proteins in eukaryotic cells, such as kinases, phosphatases, kinesins, transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins, DNA-repair enzymes, and metabolic enzymes (PMID:11911881)."
JUMONJI,JMJ,coregulators,"The jumonji (jmj) gene was identified by a mouse gene trap approach and has essential roles in the development of multiple tissues. The Jmj protein has a DNA binding domain, ARID, and two conserved jmj domains (jmjN and jmjC). In many diverse species including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, there are many jumonji family proteins that have only the jmjC domain or both jmj domains. Recently, Jmj protein was found to be a transcriptional repressor. Several proteins in the jumonji family are involved in transcriptional repression and/or chromatin regulation (PMID:16715513). The jmjC-domain containing proteins were found to be able to remove histone methyl groups. Multiple JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases have been identified in animal cells, which are divided into distinct groups according to sequence similarities, including JARID/KDM5, JMJD1/JHDM2/KDM3, JMJD2/KDM4, JMJD3/KDM6, JHDM1/FBX/KDM2 and the JmjC domain-only group. Different groups target specific histone lysines at different methylation states. Rice and Arabidopsis contain Jmj proteins that are important for the regulation of gene expression in those respective organisms (PMID:21419882)."
Aux/IAA,IAA,coregulators,"Aux/IAA genes are genes that code for small nuclear proteins, 18 to 35-kD. These proteins function as transcriptional repressors by dimerizing with Auxin response factors (ARFs) that reside on auxin responsive promoter elements (AuxREs). Most Aux/IAA proteins have four conserved domains, I-IV. Domain I is an active repression domain with a conserved LxLxL motif that is important for conferring repression. Domain II interacts with an F-box protein TIR1, a component of the SCFTIR1 ubiquitin ligase complex. Auxin increases this interaction in a dose-dependent manner, promoting the rapid degradation of Aux/IAA proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Mutations in this domain result in increased stability of the Aux/IAA protein and increased repression of the AuxRE. Domains III and IV have a similar amino acid sequence to motifs III and IV found in the C-terminal domains of ARF proteins, and these motifs mediate dimerization between Aux/IAA and ARF proteins (PMID:14742873)."
